5.0,Saqib zahoor,Cant ask for more !!!,"I had been using bold 4 for the past 3 years and i could never fancy using the touchscreen phones market has been infested with. I was almost on the verge of buying an iphone or samsung note when i heard about the passport launch. Although it was out of my budget but amazon put it up on flash sale and i could not resist the temptation of going for it. Bought it for Rs 41,800 and let me tell you its worth every penny spent. It surely looks different but you will have no problems handling the phone if you are bi-dextruous. This is a phone which is going to grab eye balls whenever you are gonna take it out of your pocket. Yesss, it does fit in even inside a jeans pocket. Talking about the battery, i haven't seen such incredible battery time ever since those good old black and white nokia days. A mixed usage would at least last you a day and a half. The touch interface is amazingly smooth and the keyboard is flawless (does take you a few days to get accustomed to the new format). Overall, i could safely say that its the best handset i have used so far. Way to go bb.",11 February 2015,3,Verified Purchase,"""R30BGS2D8RB6RX"""

4.0,AEL,The Passport of Passports...,"Indeed it is the best BlackBerry yet!,Most available Apps programmed for this iOS (10+) suffice but a few more would have been much, much better.,Almost all on this phone functions well but some basic things in Contacts need to be improved ASAP:,1. Import of data (somewhat cumbersome and troublesome).,2. Search functionality should be taken to a new level (not enough, eg. search contacts by city, etc.),3. Nickname does not show up in address look-ups (older versions had this enabled. Today you have to get into the edit mode to view this detail. Why?).,4. Old contacts (Version 7) showed you ""Mobile 1"" and ""Mobile 2"", etc. That way you knew your first choice. Now that's lost completely.,5. Etc.,There are many such little details that have been lost -- that's a step backward, rather than forward... a pity!,I consider this to be a great phone and am getting more used to it by the day, even though it's handling (because of the width) needs some special getting used to. The phone as such is refreshingly different. I wish though that the red version had emerged from day one. For that and not only that, I feel cheated. Why are customers worldwide not getting the iPhone trade-in option, like for a limited time in the U.S.A.??,(This is an opportunity to claw back and get some of that lost market share back from Apple and Samsung!)",6 December 2014,3,,"""R2J1U9CZ4GGZ3E"""
5.0,muhlan,Awesome device from Blackberry,"Previous smartphone: Lumia 920,Reasons for the change: Actually I was very happy with my Lumia 920 and Windows Phone in general. However, I was not comfortable typing on a touch screen. In addition the call quality was not so good and I had an empty battery in the afternoon even with quite light usage. I therefore bought a tablet (Lumia 2520) to work while traveling, but the tablet did not fit into my pockets and it bothered me that due to the quite large screen anyone could read along.,Why the BlackBerry Passport? The main reason was of course the keyboard and the long battery life (I bought it via Amazon.de),Build quailty: absolutely great. Nothing creaks, there are no visible columns and all push buttons have a pleasant pressure point.,Keyboard: The mere fact that I could use a physical keyboard again was great. The keys have a very pleasant pressure point and I was able to type almost as fast as on the Lumia 920 (Tipp: to train typing use the app ExtremeTypist). The fourth column with the virtual characters could be easily integrated into the flow of typing. The word suggestions are very helpful and the operating system quickly learns the user-specific words. For meaningful typing two hands are definitely needed, but that was also the case with the Lumia 920 to be honest. However if you just want to surf on the way to work you can do that easily with one hand, especially since you can use the integrated touchpad to scroll without touching the screen.,Transport: shirt pocket no, jacket inside pocket yes and jeans pocket also a yes.,Battery: with a constant use from 6:00 am (push synchronization of two e-mail accounts, Whatsapp and BBM, watching an hour of video on Youtube and internet use throughout the day in a low coverage area) the battery at 8:00 pm had still 34% left. With such a usage my Lumia 920 would have shut down already at around 4:00 pm. What really impressed me was the low battery consumption while using the BlackBerry Passport as a media player via bluetooth: even after four hours of music playing the battery was still at 80% (starting wih 90%). The BlackBerry Passport connected both to an Audi and a Ford without any problems.,Screen: the high resolution and the bright colors are well known specifications and I was not dissapointed. But what really surprised me was how pleasant the wide screen is for reading documents and web pages without having to scroll much. Of course the Lumia 920 had the landscape mode, but while you have to scroll less sideways you have to scroll even more vertically.,Apps: I was never a big app user therefore the amount of apps available was not such a relevant criteria for me. However, the offer via the Amazon store is quite large. Also, I have downloaded and installed the app Snap (which was quite easy even for a non IT guy like me) and thereby I have access to almost all Android apps. The Android apps I have downloaded are all working properly. SafeGuard for checking apps from non BlackBerry World sources for known malware is also a nice feature.,Reception and call quality: here I could perform a direct test because with the Lumia 920 I had very poor reception in my workplace. After using the BlackBerry Passport for a call for the first time the person on the other end of the line asked me if I was outside since the call quality was so good. So nothing to add regarding call quality.,BlackBerry assistant: quite useful as far as calendar and e-mail function is concerned, but in other areas there is still some catch up to do to get on a even level with the competition (remeber I am talking about the assisstant in German so the user experience could be much better in Englisch).,Photo and Video: I am completely satisfied with the quality, only the autofocus is sometimesa bit slow. The story maker app and the possibility to zoom in and out of a running video should also be mentioned on the plus side.,Operating System: I will not go into the details of the operating system, but instead make a gross comparison with Windows Phone. The first ""shock"" was of course great, since I was used to the cool Metro Design home screen of my Lumia 920. To be honest I still miss the home screen from time to time where you can put the most relevant apps, but BlackBerry ""compensates"" that by giving me the possibility to arrange my apps in folders. Another great feature is the BlackBerry hub where I can see all important messages and mails at a glance (for all so-called journalists who complain about the huge number of messages being shown in the hub in their tests: you can specify which messages should appear in the hub and which not). The performance of BES10 is very fluid and so far I had no sudden shut downs or freezes. The browser in my opinion is better and faster than the browser of Windows Phone. All in all I really got accostumed to BES10 quickly and while there are some features that I miss from Windows Phone I will not go back. The two things that really annoy me are that you can not turn of the shutter sound of the camera and the sound while dialing a number - I mean WTF how hard can it be to implement that option?,Final thoughts: I have written the entire review on the BlackBerry Passport and the experience was almost as good as writing it on a Laptop. I have used the BlackBerry Passport for over a month now and it became my main working device on the go and at home. While there is room for improvement on the software side I have to say that the BlackBerry Passport is a f*****ing awesome device.",19 November 2014,3,,"""RNKZWLQTIJN7M"""
5.0,SV,Fantastic Work Phone,"Fantastic phone for email and messaging. The BB Hub is probably the best feature of this phone. I track over 8 email ids for work and there is no phone that can do it better. Have used the iPhone and Android but came back to BB because productivity in terms of work related communication mattered to me more than use of apps in the course of a typical workday. I use this phone for emails and browsing (very good) but prefer my iPad for apps like Flipboard etc. The touch sensitive trackpad makes typing a breeze. I also appreciate BB Blend. This feature allows me to get a desktop view of the BB Hub on my computer when in office. I can view and reply straight from my computer. BB Blend works for emails and BBM. I hope they open it up so that I can view and reply to messages from third party apps like WhatsApp.,Form factor does require getting used to but the high screen resolution and additional horizontal space makes reading a pleasure and one gets used to holding and using the phone. If you track multiple email accounts, forward and reply to a large number of emails, read excel, pdf, powerpoint on a mobile, and browse regularly on your phone then you should consider this device.

4.0,Dev K. Roy,Passport vs HTC One M8 and Iphone 6,"I have all three phones concurrently and would like give an review based on my experience with all three devices but focusing on the Passport primarily. When they tell you that the Passport is a productivity machine I have to agree with the categorization. The Hub is awesome I have all my mail accounts including WhatsApp, Linked, Facebook, Instagram (Igrann Pro) ,google chat, etc. I hear people say is that not an information overload on the Hub? The answer is actually NO this is because you can choose to see what is always displayed and accounts that are displayed when you select them.,Mail -- is butter smooth I cannot say how much better it is than the Gmail app on the HTC M8 or the Mail app on the iPhone 6. The issue I have with Gmail on the HTC(android in general) is that if you have non Gmail accounts you have to rely on the Mail app which is  pretty poor and laggy. Mail on IOS 8.xx is an improvement but you still get ""the message cannot download at this time"" but it does have some nifty features like recognising tracking numbers and dates for appointments etc. The testament of how good the Hub is that even when I in from of my computer I look to reply to emails using my Passport (also the keyboard has a part to play here). The email on the BB is clear and I actually am able to read some reports that I get instead of skimming them as I do both on the M8 and the iPhone 6,This for me is priceless.  The passport is a couple of evolutions ahead of the competition,Other Messaging - Here again while the fact that whatsapp on iPhone and Android are able to compress large videos before sending across the BB 10.3 Whatsapp cannot/does not. This might be a showstopper for some for others. Here I would give the competition the advantage though caveat it that you don't have a single point of integration as the Hub (Snowball for Android is trying to do the same) and No notifications do not count in the integrated hub,Typing - I am pretty fast on the virtual keyboards yet I must say typing on the Passport is pure joy. For all you road warriors its like typing on an IBM Thinkpad after one of those ultraportable laptops you appreciate the key travel and the tactile feel of the keys, App notifications - Here both the M8 and the iPhone 6 are far ahead and I am not sure whether BB10.xx will catch up anytime soon,Apps - This the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Spoiler alert IOS8 wins hands down. The passports implementation of Android 4.4.3 is not ready for the big time yet. I have had some lag performance and crashes and random errors including QNXLauncher is not something or the other do you want to shut it down. I will give a list of apps that I use that work on the device, but all in all it is a step in the right direction but a long way to go still.So the progression from IOS to BB 10.3 is a follows 80% of apps I use on IOS are there on Android 70% of those that are on Android work on bb 10.3 so from IOS to BB 10.3 your app universe shrinks by 40-45%. Is it bad? not really . Is it ideal? Not really.,Apps that I Use and work are as follows (not Exhaustive but what I use),a)Salesforce Classic (better than the native connect to salesforce),b) Engadget,c)Flipboard(a bit troublesome sometimes but generally works),d) Soundhound (again better than native),e) Spotify ( yes works great),f)Guardian,Wsj (again a hit or miss and crashes or freezes often),g) Swarm (Not foursquare),Zomato,h) Pininterest,i)Roku,j)Goal.com,k)Todoist,l)Moneycontrol,Bloomberg,FT,ET,TOI(again better than Native),m) Connect for Garmin (syncs my Vivofit), Whitings ,Training Peaks,n) Luminosity(some scaling issues) ,Duolingo,Apps that I have not been able to get to work,a) Onenote,b)Viber,c) Zygna Poker, Asphalt 7,d) Bubble Ds,BB Assistant - This is slow but I will say awesome even better that Siri (but slower ) One example will highlight this ""I fee like eating a Kebab"" the assistant will take some time but come back with a list of food places with kebab in them where as Siri says ""Sorry I can't look for Restaurants in India"" common,Maps - not as straight forward as Google but not bad and I have side loaded google maps (no google play support so it won't remember your searches) otherwise works quite well,  but Nokia Here maps did not work when side loaded,Battery - I am not so sure yet on this as I do need to currently charge it every day and that could be because I am trying a lot on it everyday. So I will reserve comment on it other than it is better than an M8,Screen - here I feel the M8 might be the best but I love the form factor and clarity and brightness of the screen even at 50% brightness,4g or LTE - this is another reason my review gave it a notch down as I am not happy that the Passport does not support the 2300MHz band in India. Also I have forced 3G selection but it is ( for the new antenna tech and jargon) as good as either my M8 or iPhone 6 maybe a software update will sort this out,Looks - honestly people find the phone strange and I introduce it as the Blackberry TV and some people even believe it. I don't care.,So all in all I give it a 4 Stars because it is my goto phone for work and some play but I carry an iPhone 6 around in the evenings. This is neither practical or feasible for everyone so make your own decisions but for me the passport is here to stay",18 October 2014,126,Verified Purchase,"""RJKB83RNSKFOO"""

The pure view of lumias is unbeatable. Miss that.,* out of 32gb given to the phone, 10gb is taken by the OS itself.

I believe a person looking for some change.... something new to use, and bored of other OS must go for it.....,I didn't find it something to be priced at 50k they could have given a 40-45k.

At first it feels like a old design and a bit bulky but in just 1 hour of use it makes you feel amazed with the performance. I have purchased from seller cart to india slp and was quite disapointed with the service as i paid a premium amount for a open box piece  and a demo product infact. Amazon dint really help me out rather than promising me to help me out and later everything turned out to be fake promises. Getting back to the phone the spec is really a modern outcome from snapdragon to add one more point to every one's interest i am using this phone with a 128gb micro sd card and it works flawlessly the battery drains a bit faster than expected and as heard from other users because of android apps so better watch out for the apps compatibility. It doesn't seems to have 3450mah battery as it stand only for a day. I have switched all the backend running apps through application manager but still the same.  If you are looking out for a change from today's phone with the best security then go for it. The price which I have paid for a open box the same seller is selling it at a lower price of rs.4000 to 6000 on another platform so better watch out for the same. To be frank this will be my last purchase from amazon as never expected to be left helpless from them being a loyal customer to them. I would not even recommend amazon anymore.

'3GB RAM',& a 3450 mAh Battery!!.. This trio is a Killer!!,The battery of this phone is tested to last a good 36hrs of PROPER usage (3g, Social Networking, Gaming, MULTITASKING etc) and has a standby time of about 18 DAYS!!,4 Quality Speakers make the Passport 350% more crisp & more louder that the Galaxy s5.,The Most Innovative Feature and probably the most important and the USP of this device is the Keypad..,Now its not a normal keypad.. the keys a capactive that allows the entire keypad to double up as a Trackpad!! For example if you want to scroll up/down while reading or surfing the internet.. you can simply scroll on the physical keypad to move around your screen.. ALSO while typing a sentence if you want to delete an entire word.. you simply swipe from right to left on your keyboard and one word gets deleted per swipe..,Now THAT is something new and innovative..,The Software: BlackBerry 10.3 is NOT your old bb software it's a brand new software and super productive.. things like the BlackBerry Hub which manages ALL your msgs and notifications in ONE Place helps manage your chores all in one go. Interactive Active Frames displaying all open apps.. Video Calling..PICTURE PASSWORD.. 2 different appstores BECAUSE it HAS Alll the APPS that you need..... the amazon app store for android apps is built into the BlackBerry Passport which carries 3 LAC android apps that work on BlackBerry 10.3.. you can even sideload 98% of all Android Apps on the Passport.,All in all its a device completely one of its kind... its Unique.. ppl can make BlackBerry the butt of all jokes all they like but you can't deny that the innovation BlackBerry came up with.. Could not have been expected from companies who's latest innovations were a ""larger screen for the first time"" or something as silly as a Heart rate monitor..,Go for this one..,It's Hip to be Square & it's better to have a Tool of Productivity than a Toy for Gaming!,* * * * *",10 October 2014,79,,"""RMWBBP08ZKQ39"""

5.0,Indian User,"Using Passport in and around Kolkata, India","Even though I love new gadgets, I tend to give them pass unless I am totally confident of value for money. By this time you must have read many+too many reviews about this, especially in US and European context. I would be focusing on slightly different aspects - more on how this may or may not meet Indian expectations.,I am not even commenting on its form factor, or on whether it can fit in your trouser.,1. My buying decision,I have been a user of modest phones - Nokia E61i, Blackberry curve. But I have experienced Lumia, Samsung, Moto Android phones of family and friends. Could not see the purpose of having those phones for quite long time. Most utility apps - IRCTC, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Freecharge, Maps had bugs and usability issues.,When I studied the PP specs and booklet published by Blackberry, I instantly decided to try it. But the Indian Amazon priced it Rs. 50,000. Then, US Amazon gave a black friday offer of USD 500 and I had it delivered to Kolkata. It took Rs. 35,000 inclusive of all taxes and charges.,2. Traveling in train in and around Kolkata,Last week, I was traveling with this in local trains from Kolkata to suburbans. This area has quite good 3G connectivity from Airtel and Vodafone. And I installed Headlines Today Android app. If you run the Live TV option in the HT App, it will open the TV's video stream in native passport browser in full view. Everybody seating around me came closure to have a good view of the live TV streaming. In Chinsura (Hooghly), I Skyped my wife. The video and voice quality was simply superb.,Some questions my fellow travelers asked me: What is this? Is this a phone or a tablet? Is it available in India? How much is the price?,3. My comments on few more things,Hub: This is neat. Whenever and wherever you are, you can achieve the primary goal of a phone - communication, in the best possible way. Can't remember I felt this much at ease in being in touch with my colleagues, business, friends and family.,Battery: I have bought a Moto G (Second Gen) for my wife only a month ago. They say Android is a software engineering marvel. Can a phone afford to drain its battery in just 2 hours? In comparison, I keep 4-6 apps open in Passport. But, BB PP runs for more than a day.,Reading: Lot of people are complaining about its odd form factor. I would urge them to read emails and websites in PP and then any Android phone. You will get the answer.,Writing: I got an excel sheet with many rows and columns to calculate an EMI. It was nice the way I could enter the amounts to calculate.,4. Innovation,Lots have been written about innovations. The credit is taken mostly by the other two. One design innovation I have found awesome is your ability to manage your activities through multiple apps. All the apps are kept open in thumbnails in the homepage. (In comparison, you press a button in Android to go to the app list to close).,Criticisms,5. BB Assistant: May be I need to explore BB Assistant. Tried Google Now. It clearly and immediately picks up my Indian accent. Can't say the same with Assistant.,6. Android apps: Yes, some apps are crashing down - Coursera, Microsoft office mobile.",13 December 2014,19,,"""RIS28E0V7WCZD"""

Firstly, why is there a physical keyboard on the phone?? One of the most significant achievement of touchscreen based phones was to remove the need for a physical keyboard, does Blackberry believe in going back in time and bringing back its good ol'days of 2006!! People argue that one can create/edit docs, spreadsheets, etc. but lets be reasonable here most people will hate to do it on a 4 or 5 inch screen, as it is pretty cumbersome. Even their claim that this phone is a business phone is a misnomer; I dont know what they even mean by that. Does a professional in today's day and age require nothing more than shabby interface to edit/create docs? There are many other apps which are part of the professional milieu, moreover no one just buys a phone just for professional use these days, the phone must also serve other needs such as entertainment of the user. In any event, the moment I saw that physical keyboard I hated this abomination which Blackberry likes to call a 'smart phone'.",21 May 2015,0,,"""R9P1QLO4UW135"""

4.0,Sachin Chavan,Especially for readers and writers,"To the point:,1. The broad screen makes reading much easier, even better than the iPhone 5s and Galaxy Note 2 I used earlier. The square form is ideally suited for browsing.,2. Keypad is difficultly placed. It will take some time for me to get used to. But I am willing to put in the effort as I am extremely pissed off with all kinds of on screen keyboards. However, I prefer the keyboard of my older BlackBerry Curve over this. This is not ergonomical for typing. However, I am still typing this review on the BlackBerry Passport without any errors and at around 40 words per minute. I wouldn't have dared type so much on my iPhone 5S or Note 2.,3. BlackBerry Hub is a great productivity tool if you, like me, want to see all your communication at one place and have a clean inbox at the end of the day.,4. The sound is the best on any smartphone so far, on par with HTC One and louder. Only some Symbian Nokia phones may have upstaged it.,5. Not for viewing videos that are downloaded. But BlackBerry makes delightful auto videos of your pics and they look beautiful on this screen. When you have a gadget, it's your responsibility to find its strengths and leverage on them than to cry for what it has not.,6. Phone voice clarity awesome. Just like what you expect from BlackBerry. Signal perception on par with iPhone.,7. No covers in the market yet. Waiting to get one.,8. More than enough apps. If you aren't satisfied with what's on BlackBerry world and Amazon App, you aren't a customer BlackBerry is targeting.,9. The pics are quite good. A tad less engaging than iPhone 5S pics. But very capable.,10. BlackBerry Blend is the real icing on the cake for professionals. I can access my phone from my Macbook just for every task.,11. BlackBerry sync with Mac is smooth. I expect the same with a PC. Though I miss auto update of my iTunes purchases on my iPhone, with BlackBerry Passport I can download much more of my music purchases to my phone due to the storage card.,All in all, not everyone would like a BlackBerry passport. I always dreamt of a large screen phone with a physical keyboard with enough multimedia facility. the Passport does it for me. If you are in your 30s or 40s, spend most of the day at work, and like to chill with a few hobbies in the evening, you may want to check it out.

1.0,Adil,white elephant,"Short review: it is no replacement for either ios or Android or even windows. May be windows.,Here is long list of pros and cons:,Pros... It is surprising in that I have to mention this in 2016 but he call quality is better than iPhone that I have been faithful for last 8 years. I knew iPhone was bad because frequently I had to shout to talk and with each iteration they promised better call quality but delivered nothing.,Call quality is good but not on same class of Nokia 920 that I used for short time in 2013. Unfortunately windows font remains grainy even on high resolution.,Email works. I have been noticing frequent issues with ios gmail sync. No such issues with bb.,I think that's it. Now the long list of cons that mostly is software bugs (I am not talking about apps yet) and also arrogance of company to put cheap parts in expensive product.,Let me cover hardware parts first that should have cost company only few dollars but for some reason they decided to package cheap parts. Remember when apple was struggling they never ever did that.!,- LTE . with nearly 50% of world running on TDD, they decided to skip it. Very pathetic considering that even $100 cellphone has twin sim both supporting LTE.,- battery is not li pol instead it is normal one.,- camera lens cover is plastic and you will get scratches just by cleaning the residue of stickers. Good luck.,- LCD contrast is weak. Certainly not on class of $700 or even $300 phone.,Out of all these I would rate plastic lens cover and no TDD LTE support as deal breaker.,Now the software. If you are concerned about apps the you already are looking at wrong phone.,Here is list of very simple bugs that should have been addresses by company:,- with the amount of real estate used for keyboard they should have designed full fledged one. Alas. Stupid design and all caps letter look equally bad. Small space key is another dumb decision.,- you think you can copy your photo from main mem to sd card? Think again. It will mess up timestamp and all your photos will be jumbled up that you might have taken hours to copy from your previous phone.,- type a password wrong few times and all your content gone. They don't have any option not to do that. Be very careful leaving phone unattended in office as someone can easily wipe everything by typing wrong passwords few times.,- lock time and screen out time is not same. So you have to lock first and then power off LCD. Blah.,- Skype demands Google play services even though it is native app. And I cannot see other party.,- I tried to see how it fares in gaming but the apps from bbw fails to launch.,- even amazon that is preinstalled doesn't work.,- apps are expensive and I paid for few but its quality is pathetic (ftp app and scanner app that business person is supposed to use),- couldn't make navi work.,- business people need to book taxi. Meru cab is native app but it doesn't work.,- I got few Android app but same story there.,Some design issues:,- say you are browsing photo. Keyboard light comes on even though there is no need. That decreases available contrast. As such black area is like that of very cheap LCD screen ie way to bright for black.,- colors are Android like ie red is too red, yellow is too yellow like a windows phone and green is too green. You have to turn color to ""subdued"" and yet it remains super saturated. Makes you want to puke if you are into photo. And no I am not talking about camera. I am talking about same photo that I am seeing with ios, Android and blackberry. Blackberry is same as that of Android and that sucks. I want to see natural color.,Heating problem is there and it does get pretty hot sometimes. Like when I was transferring media from iPhone to this phone.,Overall I cannot see any value in this phone over nokia 3300. Unfortunately most are going for no expansion sd card that is must because people are using smartphone for few years and they have lot of private data that they want to have private control.,Totally avoidable.

I'm starting to use the Blackberry Travel app. BBM for free text and calls is a hit. I have a Rs 5,000 gift voucher from Amazon from the purchase and will shortly get my free JP miles as well.  The Apps stores as other reviewers have noted do have gaps but not enough to cause me any problems and I did not buy this to play games on. I have access to Blackberry World and the Amazon App store. I discovered how to side load Snap which gives me access to the Google App store as well. The keyboard is fantastic and I am zipping through emails and such in the hub.

How am I going to carry this Thing?,Though I had taken out my tape measure to see how big it would be on reading the specs I was still shocked on actually seeing it!,Slowly as I started using it I got used to this mammoth phone.,Setting up this mobile was a breeze.  The key board though is different from the BlackBerry Curve I am used to. A new learning curve here.,But a week on I am loving it. This phone slips easily in the upper shirt Pocket (though it's made for CEOs wearing a suit).,It can be easily carried and I believe that this should not deter us in using this new form factor.,It's a pleasure in using this mobile to see spreadsheets.,You can really Work Wide with the BlackBerry passport. Seeing PPT is also a pleasure. As it has a 3gb RAM big Excel sheets can be opened in a jiffy., Using blackberry for mails and sms was always excellent and the same holds true for BlackBerry passport also.,The concept is HUB is unique and all those using their mobile for business purposes will find this concept Fantastic!!,As usual the notification LED light is the highlight of BlackBerry.,The massive internal memory of 32gb with the option of inserting 128 gb micro SD is the big plus point for storage for those on the go.,As mentioned by all in many reviews you will have to use both the hands. One hand will not do. Though some of the operations are possible with a little practice.,Using this new keyboard requires a bit of practice. But you will love it once you get used to it.,This mobile is also useful for those having Telecons  frequently.,You can dial and minimise the dial up interface. You can at the same time open up spreadsheets, PPTs etc and keep participating in the conference with earphones connected. Everything can be easily minimised and accessed on the screen.,The voice clarity is excellent. You will find it a bit difficult in holding this phone initially while speaking but will get used to it.,Some Dos and Don'ts:,When speaking you will have to hold the phone in such a way that the small speaker is exactly touching the ears. If not placed properly (since its a large phone) the voice clarity may not be good. But if placed properly then the clarity is excellent,You have to download WPS office or Office suit pro as the pre- installed 'Docs to go' does not have the filter options for excel sheets. Hope Microsoft offers the MS office free for BlackBerry also as they are for Android and iOS now.,DO not sync the Hotmail address book. This creates Multiple duplicate entries and the address book slows down massively. Appears to be a Hotmail error. I had to manually delete the entire address book and transfer the address book from my BlackBerry Curve using the Bluetooth. After doing this the problem got resolved.,Security remains a largely compromised area with many mobiles. In today's world we are prone to using mobile devices for online shopping and banking services. Credit cards are used. How can we then ignore the security offered by BlackBerry? All the more the most ignored aspect is built strongly in BlackBerry devices.,What the OS 10 misses out is the facility to forward sms as mail or mail as sms which is available in older OS.,For seeing the images in mail you have to click a small arrow at the right side of the page. A bit irritating. Maybe there is a way out.,BlackBerry passport has OTG facility. A feature less written about.,An excellent phone for those on the move and also those who use their phones for mails / sms.,This device is not for playing junk games like candy crush or subway surfer., The massive battery lasts for 1.5 to 2 days on average use.

5.0,Chinmay B.,A flagship to conquer...,"My tryst with Blackberry started after the company started loosing its ground. Not so long ago i was a devout Apple user and Steve Jobs fan. After mocking lots of my friends for using crampy looking keyboard encroaching upon necessary screen space. But i use to like its stability security and simplicity. When blackberry launched Q10 it just could not go unnoticed. And finally i got it and used it as a spare phone. At times during my out-shoar visits (specially south east asia) it worked like a pro and gave me unrestricted access for data and communications. Thats when i became blackberry fan. And then i got my family also converted to blackberry. So it was a natural choice to go for Passport as it was launched.,I have been using this device as my primary driver and also have a iPhone 6 plus (an impulse buy) but there is no competition.,Its class part, the looks, feel, smooth texture , cold hard metal with silk smooth plastic body and natural feel of the keys. Its the perfect marriage of touch screen and keyboard. And what an innovation the touch Keyboard it is. Even Jonathan Ive would go bananas.,People may cry for applications but its and that deficient, specially after android stores available (snap and amazon). Though its not a perfect alliance yet its workable and hopefully improves., Hub is the most addictive and indispensable part of the BBOS. It makes your working easy and well organized.,Top LED is blackberry brainchild and after 10.3.1 upgrade its color customization is a well awaited feature.,The battery life is mammoth - goes on for 2-3 days, depending upon factors such as GPS, android app usage and games. They don't go well with battery life.

What now?,Deciding factor:,Having owned a Samsung S3 and experiencing the performance degradation, never again. Was checking for phones a few months back and found the Blackberry Passport.

UI is great, specially with the touch gestures. Excels, PowerPoint, Mail, eBooks all easy and simple to use/ read/ edit. Apps? Productivity apps can be easily downloaded off the BBM app store or the Amazon store. Works well, no issues here.,Verdict:,If work comes first, buy it. Do not look anywhere else. Definitely recommended.,One problem, that all I need to change my mind.. (for those who want),Two hands, needed for usage.

5.0,balphanso,My daily driver - Blackberry Passport,"I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks. Let me make this as objective as possible and specific to the phone:,Pros:,1. Keyboard - It is different, but on the long run is quite practical. There are times that I don't have to type statements and just swipe the words into place. It embodies the best of the real and virtual keyboard,2. Screen - Massive screen. Though a 1:1 ratio, it is serves the purpose it was built for. Watching a movie is not eye-straining, like my previous blackberry (9300, 9360 and then a Q10). 9300 had an average screen quality, 9360, upped the notch and Q10 striked a balance, but the Passport just beats then hands down. Also, clarity as comparable as any, if not better.,3. Touch experience - This is where things get different from other phones. The keyboard is a trackpad, saving quite a few smudge marks on the screen.,4. Style quotient - People will never ignore your phone, if you place it on a desk. It has been a conversation starter everytime!,5. Camera - Pretty good pictures. Just what 'I' needed.,6. Battery Life - Decided to play a game (Hues) which was puzzle game similar to 2048 for a fwe hours. After almost 6 hours of play, the battery still at 35%. Technically, I am not sure if I should put this in the pros, but as compared to earlier phones, similar games drained the battery in an hour or 2.,7. Call Quality - Was pretty good. Always clear. No network drops. But that can also be given to the fact that I also changed my SIM.,Cons:,1. Blackberry blend - I guess this app needs soime work to be done. It didn't meet 'my' expectation. You use it to reply only BBM, text and email messages. 3rd party chat apps like Whatsapp was not supported. Was let down by that. The functioning was smooth though.,2. Can't use the 'virtual' track pad on home screen. I HAVE to touch the screen. Hate smudge marks.,3. Not for 1 handed use. Driving and texting definitely out.

It surely looks different but you will have no problems handling the phone if you are bi-dextruous. This is a phone which is going to grab eye balls whenever you are gonna take it out of your pocket. Yesss, it does fit in even inside a jeans pocket. Talking about the battery, i haven't seen such incredible battery time ever since those good old black and white nokia days.

5.0,muhlan,Awesome device from Blackberry,"Previous smartphone: Lumia 920,Reasons for the change: Actually I was very happy with my Lumia 920 and Windows Phone in general. However, I was not comfortable typing on a touch screen. In addition the call quality was not so good and I had an empty battery in the afternoon even with quite light usage. I therefore bought a tablet (Lumia 2520) to work while traveling, but the tablet did not fit into my pockets and it bothered me that due to the quite large screen anyone could read along.,Why the BlackBerry Passport? The main reason was of course the keyboard and the long battery life (I bought it via Amazon.de),Build quailty: absolutely great. Nothing creaks, there are no visible columns and all push buttons have a pleasant pressure point.,Keyboard: The mere fact that I could use a physical keyboard again was great. The keys have a very pleasant pressure point and I was able to type almost as fast as on the Lumia 920 (Tipp: to train typing use the app ExtremeTypist). The fourth column with the virtual characters could be easily integrated into the flow of typing. The word suggestions are very helpful and the operating system quickly learns the user-specific words. For meaningful typing two hands are definitely needed, but that was also the case with the Lumia 920 to be honest. However if you just want to surf on the way to work you can do that easily with one hand, especially since you can use the integrated touchpad to scroll without touching the screen.,Transport: shirt pocket no, jacket inside pocket yes and jeans pocket also a yes.,Battery: with a constant use from 6:00 am (push synchronization of two e-mail accounts, Whatsapp and BBM, watching an hour of video on Youtube and internet use throughout the day in a low coverage area) the battery at 8:00 pm had still 34% left. With such a usage my Lumia 920 would have shut down already at around 4:00 pm. What really impressed me was the low battery consumption while using the BlackBerry Passport as a media player via bluetooth: even after four hours of music playing the battery was still at 80% (starting wih 90%). The BlackBerry Passport connected both to an Audi and a Ford without any problems.,Screen: the high resolution and the bright colors are well known specifications and I was not dissapointed. But what really surprised me was how pleasant the wide screen is for reading documents and web pages without having to scroll much. Of course the Lumia 920 had the landscape mode, but while you have to scroll less sideways you have to scroll even more vertically.,Apps: I was never a big app user therefore the amount of apps available was not such a relevant criteria for me. However, the offer via the Amazon store is quite large. Also, I have downloaded and installed the app Snap (which was quite easy even for a non IT guy like me) and thereby I have access to almost all Android apps. The Android apps I have downloaded are all working properly. SafeGuard for checking apps from non BlackBerry World sources for known malware is also a nice feature.,Reception and call quality: here I could perform a direct test because with the Lumia 920 I had very poor reception in my workplace. After using the BlackBerry Passport for a call for the first time the person on the other end of the line asked me if I was outside since the call quality was so good. So nothing to add regarding call quality.,BlackBerry assistant: quite useful as far as calendar and e-mail function is concerned, but in other areas there is still some catch up to do to get on a even level with the competition (remeber I am talking about the assisstant in German so the user experience could be much better in Englisch).,Photo and Video: I am completely satisfied with the quality, only the autofocus is sometimesa bit slow. The story maker app and the possibility to zoom in and out of a running video should also be mentioned on the plus side.,Operating System: I will not go into the details of the operating system, but instead make a gross comparison with Windows Phone. The first ""shock"" was of course great, since I was used to the cool Metro Design home screen of my Lumia 920. To be honest I still miss the home screen from time to time where you can put the most relevant apps, but BlackBerry ""compensates"" that by giving me the possibility to arrange my apps in folders. Another great feature is the BlackBerry hub where I can see all important messages and mails at a glance (for all so-called journalists who complain about the huge number of messages being shown in the hub in their tests: you can specify which messages should appear in the hub and which not). The performance of BES10 is very fluid and so far I had no sudden shut downs or freezes. The browser in my opinion is better and faster than the browser of Windows Phone. All in all I really got accostumed to BES10 quickly and while there are some features that I miss from Windows Phone I will not go back. The two things that really annoy me are that you can not turn of the shutter sound of the camera and the sound while dialing a number - I mean WTF how hard can it be to implement that option?,Final thoughts: I have written the entire review on the BlackBerry Passport and the experience was almost as good as writing it on a Laptop. I have used the BlackBerry Passport for over a month now and it became my main working device on the go and at home. While there is room for improvement on the software side I have to say that the BlackBerry Passport is a f*****ing awesome device.",19 November 2014,3,,"""RNKZWLQTIJN7M"""
5.0,SV,Fantastic Work Phone,"Fantastic phone for email and messaging. The BB Hub is probably the best feature of this phone. I track over 8 email ids for work and there is no phone that can do it better. Have used the iPhone and Android but came back to BB because productivity in terms of work related communication mattered to me more than use of apps in the course of a typical workday. I use this phone for emails and browsing (very good) but prefer my iPad for apps like Flipboard etc. The touch sensitive trackpad makes typing a breeze. I also appreciate BB Blend. This feature allows me to get a desktop view of the BB Hub on my computer when in office. I can view and reply straight from my computer. BB Blend works for emails and BBM. I hope they open it up so that I can view and reply to messages from third party apps like WhatsApp.,Form factor does require getting used to but the high screen resolution and additional horizontal space makes reading a pleasure and one gets used to holding and using the phone. If you track multiple email accounts, forward and reply to a large number of emails, read excel, pdf, powerpoint on a mobile, and browse regularly on your phone then you should consider this device.

5.0,Shashikant Iyengar,Blackberry Passport...It's not a Smartphone... It's a Genius Phone!!,"Big, awkward, very productive, massive battery, unique, eye catching, excellent for seeing spreadsheets.,These are the few thoughts I have about the new BlackBerry  Passport.,When I opened the box I thought ""My god! How am I going to carry this Thing?,Though I had taken out my tape measure to see how big it would be on reading the specs I was still shocked on actually seeing it!,Slowly as I started using it I got used to this mammoth phone.,Setting up this mobile was a breeze.  The key board though is different from the BlackBerry Curve I am used to. A new learning curve here.,But a week on I am loving it. This phone slips easily in the upper shirt Pocket (though it's made for CEOs wearing a suit).,It can be easily carried and I believe that this should not deter us in using this new form factor.,It's a pleasure in using this mobile to see spreadsheets.,You can really Work Wide with the BlackBerry passport. Seeing PPT is also a pleasure. As it has a 3gb RAM big Excel sheets can be opened in a jiffy., Using blackberry for mails and sms was always excellent and the same holds true for BlackBerry passport also.,The concept is HUB is unique and all those using their mobile for business purposes will find this concept Fantastic!!,As usual the notification LED light is the highlight of BlackBerry.,The massive internal memory of 32gb with the option of inserting 128 gb micro SD is the big plus point for storage for those on the go.,As mentioned by all in many reviews you will have to use both the hands. One hand will not do. Though some of the operations are possible with a little practice.,Using this new keyboard requires a bit of practice. But you will love it once you get used to it.,This mobile is also useful for those having Telecons  frequently.,You can dial and minimise the dial up interface. You can at the same time open up spreadsheets, PPTs etc and keep participating in the conference with earphones connected. Everything can be easily minimised and accessed on the screen.,The voice clarity is excellent. You will find it a bit difficult in holding this phone initially while speaking but will get used to it.,Some Dos and Don'ts:,When speaking you will have to hold the phone in such a way that the small speaker is exactly touching the ears. If not placed properly (since its a large phone) the voice clarity may not be good. But if placed properly then the clarity is excellent,You have to download WPS office or Office suit pro as the pre- installed 'Docs to go' does not have the filter options for excel sheets. Hope Microsoft offers the MS office free for BlackBerry also as they are for Android and iOS now.,DO not sync the Hotmail address book. This creates Multiple duplicate entries and the address book slows down massively. Appears to be a Hotmail error. I had to manually delete the entire address book and transfer the address book from my BlackBerry Curve using the Bluetooth. After doing this the problem got resolved.,Security remains a largely compromised area with many mobiles. In today's world we are prone to using mobile devices for online shopping and banking services. Credit cards are used. How can we then ignore the security offered by BlackBerry? All the more the most ignored aspect is built strongly in BlackBerry devices.,What the OS 10 misses out is the facility to forward sms as mail or mail as sms which is available in older OS.,For seeing the images in mail you have to click a small arrow at the right side of the page.

5.0,Chinmay B.,A flagship to conquer...,"My tryst with Blackberry started after the company started loosing its ground. Not so long ago i was a devout Apple user and Steve Jobs fan. After mocking lots of my friends for using crampy looking keyboard encroaching upon necessary screen space. But i use to like its stability security and simplicity. When blackberry launched Q10 it just could not go unnoticed. And finally i got it and used it as a spare phone. At times during my out-shoar visits (specially south east asia) it worked like a pro and gave me unrestricted access for data and communications. Thats when i became blackberry fan. And then i got my family also converted to blackberry. So it was a natural choice to go for Passport as it was launched.,I have been using this device as my primary driver and also have a iPhone 6 plus (an impulse buy) but there is no competition.,Its class part, the looks, feel, smooth texture , cold hard metal with silk smooth plastic body and natural feel of the keys. Its the perfect marriage of touch screen and keyboard. And what an innovation the touch Keyboard it is. Even Jonathan Ive would go bananas.,People may cry for applications but its and that deficient, specially after android stores available (snap and amazon). Though its not a perfect alliance yet its workable and hopefully improves., Hub is the most addictive and indispensable part of the BBOS. It makes your working easy and well organized.,Top LED is blackberry brainchild and after 10.3.1 upgrade its color customization is a well awaited feature.,The battery life is mammoth - goes on for 2-3 days, depending upon factors such as GPS, android app usage and games. They don't go well with battery life. So if you are using the device for communication with browsing and mails and phone calls, as intended and promoted by Mr Chen, its aces.,Camera is impressive and can be compared with flagships of apple nokia or sony (my personal experience).,Pricing is fair and goodies bundled are very attractive.

4.0,Dev K. Roy,Passport vs HTC One M8 and Iphone 6,"I have all three phones concurrently and would like give an review based on my experience with all three devices but focusing on the Passport primarily. When they tell you that the Passport is a productivity machine I have to agree with the categorization. The Hub is awesome I have all my mail accounts including WhatsApp, Linked, Facebook, Instagram (Igrann Pro) ,google chat, etc. I hear people say is that not an information overload on the Hub? The answer is actually NO this is because you can choose to see what is always displayed and accounts that are displayed when you select them.,Mail -- is butter smooth I cannot say how much better it is than the Gmail app on the HTC M8 or the Mail app on the iPhone 6. The issue I have with Gmail on the HTC(android in general) is that if you have non Gmail accounts you have to rely on the Mail app which is  pretty poor and laggy. Mail on IOS 8.xx is an improvement but you still get ""the message cannot download at this time"" but it does have some nifty features like recognising tracking numbers and dates for appointments etc. The testament of how good the Hub is that even when I in from of my computer I look to reply to emails using my Passport (also the keyboard has a part to play here). The email on the BB is clear and I actually am able to read some reports that I get instead of skimming them as I do both on the M8 and the iPhone 6,This for me is priceless.  The passport is a couple of evolutions ahead of the competition,Other Messaging - Here again while the fact that whatsapp on iPhone and Android are able to compress large videos before sending across the BB 10.3 Whatsapp cannot/does not. This might be a showstopper for some for others. Here I would give the competition the advantage though caveat it that you don't have a single point of integration as the Hub (Snowball for Android is trying to do the same) and No notifications do not count in the integrated hub,Typing - I am pretty fast on the virtual keyboards yet I must say typing on the Passport is pure joy. For all you road warriors its like typing on an IBM Thinkpad after one of those ultraportable laptops you appreciate the key travel and the tactile feel of the keys, App notifications - Here both the M8 and the iPhone 6 are far ahead and I am not sure whether BB10.xx will catch up anytime soon,Apps - This the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Spoiler alert IOS8 wins hands down. The passports implementation of Android 4.4.3 is not ready for the big time yet. I have had some lag performance and crashes and random errors including QNXLauncher is not something or the other do you want to shut it down. I will give a list of apps that I use that work on the device, but all in all it is a step in the right direction but a long way to go still.So the progression from IOS to BB 10.3 is a follows 80% of apps I use on IOS are there on Android 70% of those that are on Android work on bb 10.3 so from IOS to BB 10.3 your app universe shrinks by 40-45%. Is it bad? not really . Is it ideal? Not really.,Apps that I Use and work are as follows (not Exhaustive but what I use),a)Salesforce Classic (better than the native connect to salesforce),b) Engadget,c)Flipboard(a bit troublesome sometimes but generally works),d) Soundhound (again better than native),e) Spotify ( yes works great),f)Guardian,Wsj (again a hit or miss and crashes or freezes often),g) Swarm (Not foursquare),Zomato,h) Pininterest,i)Roku,j)Goal.com,k)Todoist,l)Moneycontrol,Bloomberg,FT,ET,TOI(again better than Native),m) Connect for Garmin (syncs my Vivofit), Whitings ,Training Peaks,n) Luminosity(some scaling issues) ,Duolingo,Apps that I have not been able to get to work,a) Onenote,b)Viber,c) Zygna Poker, Asphalt 7,d) Bubble Ds,BB Assistant - This is slow but I will say awesome even better that Siri (but slower ) One example will highlight this ""I fee like eating a Kebab"" the assistant will take some time but come back with a list of food places with kebab in them where as Siri says ""Sorry I can't look for Restaurants in India"" common,Maps - not as straight forward as Google but not bad and I have side loaded google maps (no google play support so it won't remember your searches) otherwise works quite well,  but Nokia Here maps did not work when side loaded,Battery - I am not so sure yet on this as I do need to currently charge it every day and that could be because I am trying a lot on it everyday. So I will reserve comment on it other than it is better than an M8,Screen - here I feel the M8 might be the best but I love the form factor and clarity and brightness of the screen even at 50% brightness,4g or LTE - this is another reason my review gave it a notch down as I am not happy that the Passport does not support the 2300MHz band in India. Also I have forced 3G selection but it is ( for the new antenna tech and jargon) as good as either my M8 or iPhone 6 maybe a software update will sort this out,Looks - honestly people find the phone strange and I introduce it as the Blackberry TV and some people even believe it. I don't care.,So all in all I give it a 4 Stars because it is my goto phone for work and some play but I carry an iPhone 6 around in the evenings. This is neither practical or feasible for everyone so make your own decisions but for me the passport is here to stay",18 October 2014,126,Verified Purchase,"""RJKB83RNSKFOO"""

U'll fall in love with it.,* built is strong and attractive. It is not that difficult to carry.,PROS:-,* when u play a video at full screen, since it's a square screen, u can view it only in the half of the screen.,* 1 app that I really need and didn't work was bookmyshow,* camera of my Nokia lumia 920 was amazing. The pure view of lumias is unbeatable. Miss that.,* out of 32gb given to the phone, 10gb is taken by the OS itself. But yaa it gives u an option of the mem card.,BOTTOM LINE:- this phone gives all the features and functions given by any other phone, but with its own way. I believe a person looking for some change.... something new to use, and bored of other OS must go for it.....,I didn't find it something to be priced at 50k they could have given a 40-45k. But then again the same thing goes for iPhone 6.,Don't buy it if u're a full on app maniac. Buy it if you look for basic apps + some new and impressive operating system.,And there is nothing like it's only for business going boys. It's a complete package. If u're a music lover or a whatsapp guy..... or facebook girl or calling up is ur taste...... u can go for it. Not an issue.,I am having great fun using it.! I guess I am the only one with this in my college :p,And yes, ofcourse the first look on people's face when they see that phone in ur hand.

1.0,Adil,white elephant,"Short review: it is no replacement for either ios or Android or even windows. May be windows.,Here is long list of pros and cons:,Pros... It is surprising in that I have to mention this in 2016 but he call quality is better than iPhone that I have been faithful for last 8 years. I knew iPhone was bad because frequently I had to shout to talk and with each iteration they promised better call quality but delivered nothing.,Call quality is good but not on same class of Nokia 920 that I used for short time in 2013. Unfortunately windows font remains grainy even on high resolution.,Email works. I have been noticing frequent issues with ios gmail sync. No such issues with bb.,I think that's it. Now the long list of cons that mostly is software bugs (I am not talking about apps yet) and also arrogance of company to put cheap parts in expensive product.,Let me cover hardware parts first that should have cost company only few dollars but for some reason they decided to package cheap parts. Remember when apple was struggling they never ever did that.!,- LTE . with nearly 50% of world running on TDD, they decided to skip it. Very pathetic considering that even $100 cellphone has twin sim both supporting LTE.,- battery is not li pol instead it is normal one.,- camera lens cover is plastic and you will get scratches just by cleaning the residue of stickers. Good luck.,- LCD contrast is weak. Certainly not on class of $700 or even $300 phone.,Out of all these I would rate plastic lens cover and no TDD LTE support as deal breaker.,Now the software. If you are concerned about apps the you already are looking at wrong phone.,Here is list of very simple bugs that should have been addresses by company:,- with the amount of real estate used for keyboard they should have designed full fledged one. Alas. Stupid design and all caps letter look equally bad. Small space key is another dumb decision.,- you think you can copy your photo from main mem to sd card? Think again. It will mess up timestamp and all your photos will be jumbled up that you might have taken hours to copy from your previous phone.,- type a password wrong few times and all your content gone. They don't have any option not to do that. Be very careful leaving phone unattended in office as someone can easily wipe everything by typing wrong passwords few times.,- lock time and screen out time is not same. So you have to lock first and then power off LCD. Blah.,- Skype demands Google play services even though it is native app. And I cannot see other party.,- I tried to see how it fares in gaming but the apps from bbw fails to launch.,- even amazon that is preinstalled doesn't work.,- apps are expensive and I paid for few but its quality is pathetic (ftp app and scanner app that business person is supposed to use),- couldn't make navi work.,- business people need to book taxi. Meru cab is native app but it doesn't work.,- I got few Android app but same story there.,Some design issues:,- say you are browsing photo. Keyboard light comes on even though there is no need. That decreases available contrast. As such black area is like that of very cheap LCD screen ie way to bright for black.,- colors are Android like ie red is too red, yellow is too yellow like a windows phone and green is too green. You have to turn color to ""subdued"" and yet it remains super saturated. Makes you want to puke if you are into photo. And no I am not talking about camera. I am talking about same photo that I am seeing with ios, Android and blackberry. Blackberry is same as that of Android and that sucks. I want to see natural color.,Heating problem is there and it does get pretty hot sometimes. Like when I was transferring media from iPhone to this phone.,Overall I cannot see any value in this phone over nokia 3300. Unfortunately most are going for no expansion sd card that is must because people are using smartphone for few years and they have lot of private data that they want to have private control.,Totally avoidable.

At first it feels like a old design and a bit bulky but in just 1 hour of use it makes you feel amazed with the performance. I have purchased from seller cart to india slp and was quite disapointed with the service as i paid a premium amount for a open box piece  and a demo product infact. Amazon dint really help me out rather than promising me to help me out and later everything turned out to be fake promises. Getting back to the phone the spec is really a modern outcome from snapdragon to add one more point to every one's interest i am using this phone with a 128gb micro sd card and it works flawlessly the battery drains a bit faster than expected and as heard from other users because of android apps so better watch out for the apps compatibility. It doesn't seems to have 3450mah battery as it stand only for a day. I have switched all the backend running apps through application manager but still the same.  If you are looking out for a change from today's phone with the best security then go for it. The price which I have paid for a open box the same seller is selling it at a lower price of rs.4000 to 6000 on another platform so better watch out for the same. To be frank this will be my last purchase from amazon as never expected to be left helpless from them being a loyal customer to them. I would not even recommend amazon anymore.

5.0,Indian User,"Using Passport in and around Kolkata, India","Even though I love new gadgets, I tend to give them pass unless I am totally confident of value for money. By this time you must have read many+too many reviews about this, especially in US and European context. I would be focusing on slightly different aspects - more on how this may or may not meet Indian expectations.,I am not even commenting on its form factor, or on whether it can fit in your trouser.,1. My buying decision,I have been a user of modest phones - Nokia E61i, Blackberry curve. But I have experienced Lumia, Samsung, Moto Android phones of family and friends. Could not see the purpose of having those phones for quite long time. Most utility apps - IRCTC, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Freecharge, Maps had bugs and usability issues.,When I studied the PP specs and booklet published by Blackberry, I instantly decided to try it. But the Indian Amazon priced it Rs. 50,000. Then, US Amazon gave a black friday offer of USD 500 and I had it delivered to Kolkata. It took Rs. 35,000 inclusive of all taxes and charges.,2. Traveling in train in and around Kolkata,Last week, I was traveling with this in local trains from Kolkata to suburbans. This area has quite good 3G connectivity from Airtel and Vodafone. And I installed Headlines Today Android app. If you run the Live TV option in the HT App, it will open the TV's video stream in native passport browser in full view. Everybody seating around me came closure to have a good view of the live TV streaming. In Chinsura (Hooghly), I Skyped my wife. The video and voice quality was simply superb.,Some questions my fellow travelers asked me: What is this? Is this a phone or a tablet? Is it available in India? How much is the price?,3. My comments on few more things,Hub: This is neat. Whenever and wherever you are, you can achieve the primary goal of a phone - communication, in the best possible way. Can't remember I felt this much at ease in being in touch with my colleagues, business, friends and family.,Battery: I have bought a Moto G (Second Gen) for my wife only a month ago. They say Android is a software engineering marvel. Can a phone afford to drain its battery in just 2 hours? In comparison, I keep 4-6 apps open in Passport. But, BB PP runs for more than a day.,Reading: Lot of people are complaining about its odd form factor. I would urge them to read emails and websites in PP and then any Android phone. You will get the answer.,Writing: I got an excel sheet with many rows and columns to calculate an EMI. It was nice the way I could enter the amounts to calculate.,4. Innovation,Lots have been written about innovations. The credit is taken mostly by the other two. One design innovation I have found awesome is your ability to manage your activities through multiple apps. All the apps are kept open in thumbnails in the homepage. (In comparison, you press a button in Android to go to the app list to close).,Criticisms,5. BB Assistant: May be I need to explore BB Assistant. Tried Google Now. It clearly and immediately picks up my Indian accent. Can't say the same with Assistant.,6. Android apps: Yes, some apps are crashing down - Coursera, Microsoft office mobile.",13 December 2014,19,,"""RIS28E0V7WCZD"""

4.0,Sachin Chavan,Especially for readers and writers,"To the point:,1. The broad screen makes reading much easier, even better than the iPhone 5s and Galaxy Note 2 I used earlier. The square form is ideally suited for browsing.,2. Keypad is difficultly placed. It will take some time for me to get used to. But I am willing to put in the effort as I am extremely pissed off with all kinds of on screen keyboards. However, I prefer the keyboard of my older BlackBerry Curve over this. This is not ergonomical for typing. However, I am still typing this review on the BlackBerry Passport without any errors and at around 40 words per minute. I wouldn't have dared type so much on my iPhone 5S or Note 2.,3. BlackBerry Hub is a great productivity tool if you, like me, want to see all your communication at one place and have a clean inbox at the end of the day.,4. The sound is the best on any smartphone so far, on par with HTC One and louder. Only some Symbian Nokia phones may have upstaged it.,5. Not for viewing videos that are downloaded. But BlackBerry makes delightful auto videos of your pics and they look beautiful on this screen. When you have a gadget, it's your responsibility to find its strengths and leverage on them than to cry for what it has not.,6. Phone voice clarity awesome. Just like what you expect from BlackBerry. Signal perception on par with iPhone.,7. No covers in the market yet. Waiting to get one.,8. More than enough apps. If you aren't satisfied with what's on BlackBerry world and Amazon App, you aren't a customer BlackBerry is targeting.,9. The pics are quite good. A tad less engaging than iPhone 5S pics. But very capable.,10. BlackBerry Blend is the real icing on the cake for professionals. I can access my phone from my Macbook just for every task.,11. BlackBerry sync with Mac is smooth. I expect the same with a PC. Though I miss auto update of my iTunes purchases on my iPhone, with BlackBerry Passport I can download much more of my music purchases to my phone due to the storage card.,All in all, not everyone would like a BlackBerry passport. I always dreamt of a large screen phone with a physical keyboard with enough multimedia facility. the Passport does it for me. If you are in your 30s or 40s, spend most of the day at work, and like to chill with a few hobbies in the evening, you may want to check it out.

Firstly, why is there a physical keyboard on the phone?? One of the most significant achievement of touchscreen based phones was to remove the need for a physical keyboard, does Blackberry believe in going back in time and bringing back its good ol'days of 2006!! People argue that one can create/edit docs, spreadsheets, etc. but lets be reasonable here most people will hate to do it on a 4 or 5 inch screen, as it is pretty cumbersome. Even their claim that this phone is a business phone is a misnomer; I dont know what they even mean by that. Does a professional in today's day and age require nothing more than shabby interface to edit/create docs? There are many other apps which are part of the professional milieu, moreover no one just buys a phone just for professional use these days, the phone must also serve other needs such as entertainment of the user.

Productivity apps can be easily downloaded off the BBM app store or the Amazon store. Works well, no issues here.,Verdict:,If work comes first, buy it. Do not look anywhere else.

Once you use it, you will surely like it. The only awkward movement is when you watch videos or play games and that's when you really miss the rectangular screens!.,- Last but not the least, this unique looking phone draws people's attention.

5.0,balphanso,My daily driver - Blackberry Passport,"I have been using this phone for the last 3 weeks. Let me make this as objective as possible and specific to the phone:,Pros:,1. Keyboard - It is different, but on the long run is quite practical. There are times that I don't have to type statements and just swipe the words into place. It embodies the best of the real and virtual keyboard,2. Screen - Massive screen. Though a 1:1 ratio, it is serves the purpose it was built for. Watching a movie is not eye-straining, like my previous blackberry (9300, 9360 and then a Q10). 9300 had an average screen quality, 9360, upped the notch and Q10 striked a balance, but the Passport just beats then hands down. Also, clarity as comparable as any, if not better.,3. Touch experience - This is where things get different from other phones. The keyboard is a trackpad, saving quite a few smudge marks on the screen.,4. Style quotient - People will never ignore your phone, if you place it on a desk. It has been a conversation starter everytime!,5. Camera - Pretty good pictures. Just what 'I' needed.,6. Battery Life - Decided to play a game (Hues) which was puzzle game similar to 2048 for a fwe hours. After almost 6 hours of play, the battery still at 35%. Technically, I am not sure if I should put this in the pros, but as compared to earlier phones, similar games drained the battery in an hour or 2.,7. Call Quality - Was pretty good. Always clear. No network drops. But that can also be given to the fact that I also changed my SIM.,Cons:,1. Blackberry blend - I guess this app needs soime work to be done. It didn't meet 'my' expectation. You use it to reply only BBM, text and email messages. 3rd party chat apps like Whatsapp was not supported. Was let down by that. The functioning was smooth though.,2. Can't use the 'virtual' track pad on home screen. I HAVE to touch the screen. Hate smudge marks.,3. Not for 1 handed use. Driving and texting definitely out. Guess that will save my life, but when I am walking with groceries or my baby, it is tad difficult to use it.,Overall, the phone is something that I am personally glad to own. And will continue to promote the Blackberry 10 phones. They are unique and practical. Saves you ample time while working, socializing, and playing (though play is limited, due to the apps).",5 February 2015,2,,"""RVHPYQLXENV23"""
